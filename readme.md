This is an example app for [Laravel 4 Nested Set][1] package.

It uses almost all features of the package. The layout is based on 
[Twitter Bootstrap][2] markup.

It is not intended to be used in production due to incomplete browsers support
and other issues.

After the application is downloaded and configured, run following command to set 
up the database:

```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Note that this application uses latest _dev_ versions of Laravel 4 and NestedSet 
packages.
